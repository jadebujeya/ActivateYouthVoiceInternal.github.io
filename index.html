<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>
Hi Everyone!
<br>
This is an internal website for us to share documents and other information amoungst ourselves. At this stage, it's not intended to be shared with clients anyone outside of AYV, although once we've got the style and setup sorted out, it shouldn't be to hard to use the same style settings to create a website for clients. Please feel free to have a look around. The site is still pretty rudimentary at the moment, but I've included a list of known problems and things I'd like to try and fix or add for the next update at the bottom on this page. If you find or think of anything that's not on it, please email me to let me know. Obviously, I'm mostly learning this as I go, so some things will be a bit beyond my abilities for a while yet, but it's impritant to have aspirations!
